Components, hooks, props… everything sounded foreign. For a moment, I thought maybe I’m just not cut out for coding. But over time, I realized that feeling overwhelmed isn’t a sign of failure—it’s part of the learning process. The trick is figuring out how to manage it."

        "text": "For me, the biggest change came when I stopped trying to learn everything at once. Instead of saying, “I need to master Node.js today,” I broke it down into tiny, manageable chunks. One day, I’d focus on understanding modules. The next day, I’d build a simple API with a single endpoint. Little by little, these micro wins added up, and suddenly, concepts that felt impossible became manageable."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Another game-changer was shifting from reading to doing. Tutorials are great, but nothing beats actually writing code. I learned faster when I tried to implement small ideas—even if they failed. Breaking things, debugging, and figuring out why something doesn’t work teaches more than any guide could. That’s why I always have at least one mini project going—something small but concrete that applies what I just learned."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Finally, I stopped comparing myself to others online. Someone else’s full-stack app or complex script can be intimidating, but it doesn’t define your pace. Learning tech is personal—you move at your speed, and what matters is consistent, hands-on practice."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
